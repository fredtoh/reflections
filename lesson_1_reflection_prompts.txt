How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Fill in your answer here
The diffs can be compared (- and + marks). They tell me what I have changed, so if something doesn’t look right, I should be able to identify it instantly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Fill in your answer here
It helps to trigger the thought process and the considerations I have made when writing the codes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here
Pros of creating a commit:
I get to choose what and when to make the commit.

Cons of creating a commit:
I have to be decide whether I am making a logical change, whether the change is too big, too small or just right…


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here
For files that references or imports from/exports to other files, such as HTML/CSS/JS files, it may be necessary to track multiple files in one commit. Git is good at this.

For files that are handled singly or has its dedicated application, and doesn’t require references to other files, then treating each files separately makes better sense, rather than making a commit of a bunch of files. It may be tempting to group a bunch of files with the same file extensions or file types, such as photos or music files, but these types of files would not be suitable for Git commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here
git log for the commit IDs that comes with a summary note on the commit.
git diff between two IDs can bring out the insertions and deletions made.
—stat flag summarizes # of insertions and deletions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Fill in your answer here
I can always go back to the version that doesn’t break and use git diff to debug the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Fill in your answer here
Put my codes in there and let it take care of version control!

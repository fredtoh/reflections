What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The Git repository is empty. Need to initialize in order to do a commit. Git doesn’t do any commits in the init stage because it doesn’t know what you want to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The repository keeps a record of the commits and changes.
